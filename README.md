# SPE LaTeX Template

This repository contains template files to submit papers according to the Society of Petroleum Engineers' requirements.

The style was originally obtained from [SPE's Author Resources](https://www.spe.org/en/authors/resources), with modifications according to the instructions and guides provided.
We do not claim to hold the copyright or ownership for any SPE file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend anyone wishing to use the files here provided to double-check the correctness of the template according to the desired journal/conference's style requirements.

We are open to suggestions and contributions to the repository.
Please feel free to open pull requests/issues for contribution and discussion.

## Instructions

### Installation

It suffices to use the class file as the project's *documentclass*.
For this purpose, the user can either:

- Download the [*spe* class file](src/spe.cls) from the [*src* directory](src) to the same directory as the user's main LaTeX file.
- Clone the repository and make sure the [*src* directory](src) can be seen by LaTeX. 
As an example, in MiKTeX for Windows one can add it as a TEXMF root directory under [MiKTeX Console's settings](https://miktex.org/kb/texmf-roots).

### Usage

To use the class in the main file, one of the `journal` or `conference` options needs to be loaded, i.e.

```latex
\documentclass[journal]{spe}
or
\documentclass[conference]{spe}
```

The following commands need to be set for the title block. 
For commands that hold more than one information, separate each by semicolons (e.g. multiple authors).

The `\spemaketitle` command creates the title block.

Example:
```latex
...
\spevenue{2024 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition}
\spemanuscriptnumber{SPE-123456-MS}
\spetitle{My Awesome Paper}
\speauthors{A. One; A. Two; A. Three; A. Four}
\speaffiliations{My University, City One, TX, USA; Other Company, City Two, TX, USA}
\speauthoraffiliations{1; 1; 2; 1}
\specorrespondingauthor{1; email@myuniversity.edu}
\spekeywords{keyword1; keyword2}

\begin{document}
\spemaketitle
...
```

To reference figures and tables, use `\speref` or `\sperefp`.
If it's the first reference of an item in the paper, use `\spefirstref` or `\spefirstrefp`.

For section headings, use the commands `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection` and `\subsubsubsection`.
